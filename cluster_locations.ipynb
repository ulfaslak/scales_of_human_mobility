    "We want to show that spatial movement of humans (and likely other animals too) is not scale-free but rather, bound by multiple levels of *containers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are nested regions in space such as *city*, *neighborhood*, and *building*—the *city* contains *neighborhoods* and each *neighborhood* contains *buildings*. This multi-level description of space as a tree of nested containers is in theory unbounded, but for practical purposes related to describing human mobility, we can currently say that the root container is *planet Earth* and the furthest leaf container is something like a *table* class where nodes are *chair*. As a moves around in the world, she occupies different nodes in the tree of containers. If she is a home, movements between *room* containers can be described as a multi-level walk on all containers smaller than *building* (including *building*). What I mean by this is that at the *building* level where each *room* container is a node, there is a walk. At the *room* level, however, there is also a set of walks (one for each *room* container). When she goes to the *kitchen*, for example, time spent there is stationary from the *building*-level perspective, but on the *room*-level there is all sorts of important movement: she may walk between the stove, the towel rack, the sink and the refrigerator in any order. For now we will consider these entities leaf nodes of the tree of containers, but in theory, they need not be.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we show that mobility behaves according to this description of space? I have a few ideas, which we need to test:\n",
    "* *Transitions between nodes inside a container are random.* If this is the case, inferring the different containers should not be too hard, because it allows us to view the network as a multi-level random graph. Can we make an **algorithm that searches for multiple scales of random graphs?**\n",
    "* We can possibly run a **multi-level community detection algorithm** to a graph of transitions between small stop-locations, and see how many levels meaningfully describe the network. Infomap is a good candidate here, because the graph describes flow.\n",
    "* From the perspective of different containers, we can estimate what movements have destination and which lack destination. The idea is that from the perspective of a given container, transitions are mostly random, so consecutive movements are rarely in the same direction (small or negative dot product). However, from the perspective of that same container, of two consecutive movements are in the same direction (large positive dot product) then it means that the walker is leaving that container. Yet at the level of the super-container this is just another step in a random walk where the container was a node. Not sure how to implement this, but it seems to be a good way to look at the problem.\n",
    "The **strategy** then is:\n",
    "    1. Take all the raw location data.\n",
    "    2. Compute each points's delta vector (row-wise subtract). Remove 0th point.\n",
    "    3. Compute dot products between delta vectors (row-wise dot product).\n",
    "    4. We now know if movement is directed (positive DP) or non-directed (negative DP). The magnitude of the DPs carries information about the scale at which a person moves, but we need to figure out how to deal with this."
